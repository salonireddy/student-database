# student-database
This is a project I made for my final project of high school computer science. I am only pushing this now because I wasn't aware of github back then.

I used files to store and retreive student information. This code is fully functioning and fulfils basic tasks (ofc it needs many revisions to actually be suitable for real world applications).
